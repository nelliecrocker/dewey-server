# Welcome to the Dewey Collective
The Dewey Collective is a mobile-first app that intends to decentralize the mainstream concept of a library and turn book lending into a democratized social experience.

Users can login and add books to their bookshelf, and then mark those books as borrowed when they lend them out to a friend. Once the book is returned, users mark that book as returned and it clears the lending data.

This app was created by Nellie Crocker in September 2021 as part of Eleven Fifty Academy's web development program.

The client portion of this app can be found [here](https://github.com/nelliecrocker/dewey-client).
